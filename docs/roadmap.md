# Roadmap

A proper 'roadmap' style graph or chart is TBA, however below are planned future ideas/features.

## Possibilities but not yet critical or core ideas

-   [ ] **Auxiliary intelligent recommendation features**: Think of Netflix's different recommendation sections: _"Because you watched 'X'"_, _"Catch up on unwatched episodes"_, _"Similar titles to your recent binges"_

-   [ ] **Integration with Jellyseerr**: E.g. have an in-chat button to request a new recommendation without having to actually open Jellyseerr

-   [ ] **User-specific learning questionnaires**: For the system's benefit, an optional set of questions (e.g. "which do you prefer out of these two?") or even structured conversation, to help fine-tune a model to a user. Could be good if a user has minimal watch history data
